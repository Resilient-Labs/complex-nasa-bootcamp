# Project Title: Complex NASA api

## Project description :
###  Used NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently. The nasa api after fetching returned a json() containing an object made up of an array that had nested arrays.I only needed certain properties of the array, used a for in loop to cycle through the array and pulled out the wanted Key value pair.

## User instructions on browser:
### click on the 'click' button which will generate over 400 locations for NASAs facilities and other properties
#Warning: the servers can only do about 1000 requests in an allotted time so only click when Needed
