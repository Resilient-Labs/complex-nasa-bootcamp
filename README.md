# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API

# Complex NASA API
An application that takes the locations of all the Nasa Facilties from an API.
Then there is a second weather API calls the first one to use the location data provided from the
Nasa Facilties API to give a the temperature based on the location of the facilties.

# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript 
This project took HTML, CSS, and Javascript to get the desired result. I wanted my list to appear on the DOM 
as soon as I added hit the button. Two APIs were called in order to get the location of the facility and the 
weather forecast for the current time. 
# Lessons Learned
This project taught me alot about interacting with APIs and the ways we can use the data extracted from these APIs, 
to build applications. Powerful apps can be built in a short time with code from others is the biggest lesson
I took away from this project.
