# ðŸš€ Complex NASA API

Used NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). It displays the names of the facilities, their location, and the weather at the facility currently. 

I completed the challenge: 5


I feel good about my code: 5


Learned about how much NASA is still all over the world.
