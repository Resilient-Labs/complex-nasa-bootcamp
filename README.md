## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

To make this API based website we are going to be using Javascript and fetch syntax to work with the API interfaces.

what the first API does:
gets all NASA sites
lists all sites.

what the second API does:
grabs the zip code of the site and returns weather

## Optimizations


## Lessons Learned:

A great takeaway for this project would be using for loops to deal with the parsed JSON data. using a for loop you can grab specific values, assign them to variables, and use them as parameters in other API interfaces.

## Examples:
