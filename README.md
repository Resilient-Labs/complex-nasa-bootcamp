# ðŸŽ° Week08 Bootcamp2021 Project: Complex NASA API

### Goal: Use NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently.

This is my Complex NASA API project that allows users to fetch the name, location, and current weather of all of NASA's 400 facilities.
