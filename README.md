# NASA API:
This project consisted of 2 apis. One NASA API that was found on nasa.gov and another from an open weather source. The user inputs a city, the NASA facility api should shoot out multiple facilities and addresses to those facilities to the browser, then the temperature api gets targeted and appears on the dom.

**Tech used:**
HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
This project targeted two separate API's. This was the one I most struggled with because there were many tribulations. For starters, the api did not come directly through the nasa website but from a .gov. This api crashed, and I could no longer run the code. The json response was difficult because it did not present the correct information and consistent along with lac of documentation. The weather api worked just fine so there wasn't really a problem with testing and debugging when needed.
