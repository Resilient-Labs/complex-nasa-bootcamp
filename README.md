## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This code shows the 13 unique NASA centers and allows you to click on each one to see the temperature at that location. I also included (commented out) code to display all 485 facilities if a user wished to see all of them.


## Lessons Learned:
This was my first time using two APIs in the same project and having them communicate with each other. It was a learning process. I had to assure that I was storing information from one API in a way that the other could understand and return additional information. I also learned how to carefully looping through large sets of data to remove duplicates and return specific information.
