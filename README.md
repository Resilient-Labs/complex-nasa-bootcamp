# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API

### Goal: Use NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently. 
For this API I used a NASA API to pull the geographical coordinates of all the NASA locations in their open database (I also retrieved the names of the facilities and locations on top of zipcode, city, and country info). Those coordinates were then input into an OpenWeather API that provided the temperature of the location converted to Fahrenheit
