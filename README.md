<b>Tech Used</b>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON

<b>What I Learned</b>: JavaScript still ceases to amaze me with the things I am able to create with it. In this project, Loops were especially helpful. It helped me go through a large data set and be able to select what I wanted to look for and what I needed to be displayed. Linking the weather API in this one was a bit hard too because it used latitude and longitude, but I was able to figure out how to merge it so that it was compatible with the NASA facilities API. Overall this project was hard and it pushed me, but I am extremely happy about the way it turned out.
