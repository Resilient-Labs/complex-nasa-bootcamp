# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API

### Goal: Use NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently.

### How It's Made
I used HTML and CSS+Flexbox for structure, styling and positioning.

### Functionality
For the functionality portion I used 2 API's. I first used the NASA API to retreive the name of each facility and it's location. I then took the location data and stored it in a variable. I then used the location variable to fetch data from the Open weather map API. This allowed me to display the temp of each NASA location alongside the facility name and city+state.
