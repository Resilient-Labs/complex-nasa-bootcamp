# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API, JSON

# Optimizations:
#### Created two functions that each fetch the needed JSON data. Had both functions tied to a button so it would not run as soon as the browser opened.

# Lesson Learned:
#### Learned how to create new HTML within the DOM by using createElement() createTextNode() and appendChild() methods.
