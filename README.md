I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
This project is one of my first group projects. We started this as a group and then finished it on our own or with help. The most challenging part of this projects was trying to make sure to not overuse the limit on the weather API. (Especially since NASA has over 400 facilities. ) We were able to solve this while testing by temporarily setting the loop limit to 3, until further features were added.
