## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Thoughts:

Initially misunderstood this project and had spent so long figuring out how to make 2 Nasa API's work with each other....This one wasn't too bad to work with. The only thing is that displaying all 400+ facilities makes the page very LONG. Have to compromise on being able to see the text or having a very long page.
