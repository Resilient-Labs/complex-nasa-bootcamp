# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API

### Goal: Use NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript and fetch web API

When the get facilities button is pressed, a request is sent to the NASA api which returns an array with over 400 objects inside. A few properties are saved and displayed into the DOM. A second request is made to the openweathermap api that returns the weather for a specific location.

## Lessons Learned:

You can have multiple fetch request that work together. In this project, the NASA api gave me longitude and latitude coordinates which I then used when making the request to the openweathermap api.

## Disclamer:

If you clone this project, you need to use your own API key from https://openweathermap.org/api
