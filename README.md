# 🚀 Project: Complex NASA API

### Goal: Use NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently.

* **Project Title: Nasa's Facility Locations**
  - This webpage is solely to provide information on all of nasa's facility locations including the current weather of each one.


* **Overview**
  - It pulls data from two API's. It receives the facilities, name, city, state, as well as longitude and latitude coordinates. Using those coordinates it receives the current temp from dark sky's API.
  - This page was created for those that are curious, and wish to see a list of Nasa's facilities
