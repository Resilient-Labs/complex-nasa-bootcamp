### How It's Made: 

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project  I searched for two api's that could be interlated. I then took data from the first API and created varibles to run within the second API.

### Lessons Learned:

This project taught me how to properly nest a fetch. I also learned that you can reference multiple varibles within the fetch.
