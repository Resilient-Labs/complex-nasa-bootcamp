This complex api project is requesting the locations of all Nasa facilities, and their locations from a Nasa API and using their locations to request the current weather at each of those locations from a different api. Then this information is instantly displayed on the Dom!
<hr>
This project is meant for me to further explore using different api's and is not meant for user interaction other than checking the data out of curiosity. I learned about making way to many request to the api and having those request limited, this influenced me to only allow 5 of the locations to show at once to avoid making to many request. 

Skills:  JS / HTML / CSS/ API
