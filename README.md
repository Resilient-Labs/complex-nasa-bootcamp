# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API
Utilizing both NASA's API and a Weather API, I would be able to display all of NASA's facilities including it's location and current weather!

## Tech Used:
- Fetches from NASA's API
- Fetches from Weather API
- Javascript, HTML, CSS

### Things I'm proud of:
- First time utilizing two different APIs!
- Figuring out how to grab the necessary parameters from one API fetch and incorporate it into the other
- Learning how to organize my code in a way that would avoid too many nested functions and allow for clarity between the two fetches
