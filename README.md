# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript E6, API, JSON

# Optimizations:
#### Created a for loop that runs through every object in the Nasa API and prints them on the DOM as text nodes in LI elements. The zip code of each facility is fed into the weather API to display the current temperature. 

# Lesson Learned: 
#### How to print objects to the DOM by creating text nodes in conjunction with a separate API.
