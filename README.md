## Languages Used 

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. 

## Lessons Learned 

The first challenge was finding a working API after I was no longer able to utilize a few of the weather API's I signed up for. The second challenge was figuring out how to display the temperature in degrees in imperial units, since the documentation was extremely lengthy.
