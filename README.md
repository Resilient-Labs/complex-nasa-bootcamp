# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API

### Goal: Use NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently.

## Design and Development:
**Tech Used** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, JSON: 
Create a loop or conditional that calls 3 to 5 cities / facilities to not exhaust NASA's API call limit. On the NASA developer's website, you can see all of the data listed out in a table so you can use those for examples as well.

## Reflections:
Considering some cities were not searchable by Open Weather's API, had to create conditionals to closest valid cities.
