# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API

### Goal: Use NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently. 

For this API I used a NASA API to pull the geographical coordinates of all the NASA locations in their open database (I also retrieved the names of the facilities and locations on top of zipcode, city, and country info). Those coordinates were then input into an OpenWeather API that provided the temperature of the location converted to Fahrenheit

### Lessons Learned :

- This was my first complex API project so it was daunting at first but I found that breaking it up into smaller parts was beneficial to me. I also learned to start prioritizing my pseudo code more to organize my thinking
- I got much more comfortable with my for loop code. For some reason this was a JS fundamental skill that I was still not proficient with before but now I feel much better handling iterations and writing this type of loop.
