# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API

### Goal: Use NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently. 

I used 2 APIs to calculate the weather at each NASA Facility. This was accomplished using NASA's facility API and Open Weather Map API.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs

## Lessons Learned:

This was definitely a harder project to accomplish, I learned more about the parameters needed and how 2 APIs can work together.
