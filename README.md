# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API
## A NASA Weather App

Ever wonder how hot or cold it is at a NASA facility? Well, now you can! Just make sure you have good internet and a working scrollwheel.

This app shows the information of over 400+ NASA facilities. You can find out where they are located and how the weather is there.

## A Picture of the Very Fancy Website:

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**APIs used:** https://data.nasa.gov/ and https://openweathermap.org

## Knowledge Practiced:
* Array Methods - Using .forEach() to display over hundreds of separate indexes
* Function Scope - to ensure the message for each facility were together despite being in different fetch calls
* Fetching 2 apis - using data from the NASA API to the OpenWeather API
* innerHTML - Styling the messages with a rocket emoji or positioning the weather, location on a new line

## Lessons Learned:

* API requests - Learned that the NASA API has a limit of ~900 requests so I had to be conservative with my testing
