# Complex NASA API 

I built out a site that uses NASA's API and returns all of their facility locations (~400) in a list format. Users can click the "view data" button to see all facilities displayed.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, API

Used NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Displayed are the names of the facility, the facilitiy room, its location, and the weather at the facility currently This project involved using complex APIS and learning how to use data from one API to display and return information using another API (here it's location and weather).

<!-- ## Optimizations

An array could be used as we learned more about those and objects. Will be looking to add and optimize this code in the future. -->

## Reflections:

This took a bit of trial and error, but with some help I eventually got it down and working correctly. I first started out making it using a table, but decided to stick to and ordered list. Maybe in th future I'll ehance it by creating the table!
