## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs.
This web app uses a NASA API to retrieve and display the city, state, center names, and facility names of all NASA facilities.  It then runs the location (longitude and latitude) information of each facility through a weather API to retrieve and display the current temperature at each facility.
