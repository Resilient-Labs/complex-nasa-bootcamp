# Complex NASA/Weather API
This project is a complex NASA API. I was able to utilize the longitude and latitude of the NASA API as well as the weather API. This allows the weather API to locate NASA stations within North America and will request for the current temperature(in fahrenheit).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created a complex API design for this NASA/weather API with a simple button. I used CSS to margin the button to center it. Next I centered the list of NASA stations and included the temperature underneath each station. Lastly I used JavaScript to create the behavior with the button to request for all of the NASA station locations as well as the current temperature.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that you can utitlize a loop to iterate through each of the stations to apply the correct temperature for each NASA station.
